# [60. Permutation Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/)

## 题目
The set `[1,2,3,…,n]` contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

1. "123"
1. "132"
1. "213"
1. "231"
1. "312"
1. "321"



Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
