# [437. Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/)

## 题目
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards
(traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8
```
      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1
```
Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:
1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
