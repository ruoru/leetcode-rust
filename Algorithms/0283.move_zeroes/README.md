# [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

## 题目

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given nums  = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

Note:
1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
1. Minimize the total number of operations.
