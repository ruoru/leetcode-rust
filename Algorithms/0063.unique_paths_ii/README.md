# [63. Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

## 题目
Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

For example, There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
```
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
```
The total number of unique paths is `2`.

**Note:** m and n will be at most 100.
