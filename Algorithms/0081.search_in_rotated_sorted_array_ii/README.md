# [81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

## 题目
Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
1. What if duplicates are allowed?
1. Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?


Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
   
(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

The array may contain duplicates.

## 解题思路
和[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](../0033.search-in-rotated-sorted-array)的解题思路一样，只是要先自己找到 k 的值。
