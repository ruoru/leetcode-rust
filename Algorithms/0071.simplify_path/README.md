# [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

## 题目
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.

```
For example,
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
```

click to show corner cases.

Corner Cases:
```
Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
In this case, you should return "/".
Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".
```
